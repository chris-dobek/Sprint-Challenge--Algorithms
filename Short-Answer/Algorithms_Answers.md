#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) because as the size of the input increases the runtime will also increase at the same rate


b) O(n^2) because it has a nested while loop inside of a for loop


c) O(n) because it is being called recursively

## Exercise II

The best way to solve this problem would be by using a binary search.

    Drop egg from middle:
        if egg broke:
            current floor - 1
        elif egg != broke:
            current floor + 1 until egg = broke

The runtime complexity for this problem would be O(log n).
